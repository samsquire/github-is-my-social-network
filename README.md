# GitHub is my social network
# Welcome to the profile page of samsquire

I use GitHub as my social network and I want you to join me and create content. This is like a low tech webring. I just use Markdown and HTML links.

 * I am a software engineer interested in the web and the future of technology and what I feel is good futuristic technlogy.
 * I am always looking for high quality things to read.
 * You might like [gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.html) and [nostr](https://nostr.com/)
 
 What can you do on my social network? Here's a beautiful markdown table. I'm trying to make the codename a "thing", so you can create a repository with the same name or with your own name if you really have to. This is a bit like the semantic web, microformats or [.well-known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI)
