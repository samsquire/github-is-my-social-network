# GitHub is my social network

I use GitHub as my social network and I want you to join me. I am a software engineer interested in the web and the future of technology.

I am always looking for high quality things to read.

* Create apps and share them with eachother using `replit` (https://replit.com/)
* Host the code on GitHub
